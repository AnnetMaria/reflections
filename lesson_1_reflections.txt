How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
- Use git log to view your commit history
- Use arrows up and down to scroll up and dows
- copy/paste the first (older) version 
- git diff [older version long number] [new version long number]

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
If you break someting you can always go back to the previous commit.
You can use git diff to learn what caused the error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to version control all the code I write and push it 
to my server.
