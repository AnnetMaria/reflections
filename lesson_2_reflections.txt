What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository, a .git file is created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory 
and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging are is the in between area. It is possible to
already add files to the staging are and not commit them.
I you have a change that consists of mutiple files,
you have the possibility to already add the.
Also the status command that checks on your working 
directory and the staging are, can tell you which files
are changed, not in version control etc.
