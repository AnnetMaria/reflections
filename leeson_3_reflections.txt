When would you want to use a remote repository 
rathern tah keeping all your work local?
- If I want to share my work with other people.
- If I want to collaborate on one project with other people.
- I always use a private remote repository 
  - as a safety net; if my computer crashes/breaks
    I will still have my files.
  - I work on dfferent computers, in this way I can
  access my files from any of my workspaces.
